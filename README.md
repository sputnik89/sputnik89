## Welcome to my hub!

Sputnik89's interest revolves around distributed systems in general, with a particular focus on distributed storage systems (DBMS in particular) and resource disaggregation. Currently, sputnik89 is exploring the field of serverless computing and its connection with efficient LLM serving. Alongside, sputnik89 pays close attention to emerging hardware resources and their potential of accelerating existing resource-intensive tasks. 

Sputnik89 is an imperfect model, for which reason sputnik89 keeps absorbing massive datasets human-beings feed to him.
